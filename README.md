According to the official website of remove.bg, they do not share your images or use them for any other purpose than removing the background and letting you download the result1. They also state that they delete all images from their servers after one hour2. However, they do not guarantee that the images will not be cached by third parties such as search engines or web browsers2.

It seems that you want to use remove.bg to remove the background of images and use them in your Google Blogger blogspot website. To do that, you will need to use the remove.bg API, which is a simple HTTP interface that allows you to upload images and get the results in different formats. You can find more information about the remove.bg API here.

To use the remove.bg API, you will need to get an API key from their website. You can get your first 50 API calls per month for free (see Pricing). Then, you can use one of the sample code or libraries provided by remove.bg or their community to integrate the API into your application or workflow. You can find some examples of code and libraries here.

To use the remove.bg API inside Google Blogger blogspot, you will need to embed the code in your blog posts or pages. You can do this by using the HTML editor mode in Blogger. You can find more information about how to use HTML in Blogger here.

Here is an example of how you can use the remove.bg API in a blog post:
